## This is a curated list of useful links


### Journals

* [Distill](https://distill.pub/): Absolutely incredible Machine Learning journal; all publications have interactive visualizations.

* [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/): Great place to find many recent publications in Machine Learning, CS, Mathematics, Physics, and more.

### Programming

* [Rosetta Code](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code): Think of any algorithm: This website will have a clean implementation in almost every language.
* [LeedCode](https://leetcode.com): Practice solving programming puzzles.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/): Store and share your code online.
* [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/): If you program, you have found yourself here more than once; a forum for asking questions to programming problems. Careful when looking at answers; many are incorrect.
* [Google](https://google.com): For anything you can't find on stack overflow.

### Blogs

* [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/): Lots of good posts here (and a lot of amateur posts too; be careful)

### Online Learning

* [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/): Many high quality courses here.
* [MIT Open Courseware](https://ocw.mit.edu/): More high quality courses, all free.

### Development Tools & Software

* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/): Incredible tool for rapid prototyping and data visualization.
