# Understanding Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

If you work in any sort of quantitative field, such as computer science or engineering, you have probably run into learning about eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The mathematical formulation for eigenvalues and eigenvectors is straitforwards; however, the intuition behind the formula is generally lost in most. Ideally, this post will help you develop a more robust intuition behind the math.
 
## Mathematical formulation

Given a square matrix, such as 2x2 matrix A below

A = [a_1x a1y] [a2x a2y]

the eigenvalue/eigenvector pairs exist such that

A 

Depending on the application, matrices can represent various phenomena. Generally, they are used within the context of *Linear* systems.



A = []
