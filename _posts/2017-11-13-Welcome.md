Welcome to my blog! I imagine you may have either stumbled upon it through the internet or may know me personally. Either way, I am starting this blog today in order to share my experiences and knowledge.

I plan on writing on topics spanning the fields of signal processing, machine learning, data science, and general computational science, although this list may expand in the future. Many times, there is a certain topic I want to learn more about during my spare time. I figured it would be valuable to share my learning experience with others and accelerate the growth of knowledge in the data science community. If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, feel free to email me at yliapis652@gmail.com. Stay tuned for more.
